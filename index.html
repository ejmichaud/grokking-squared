    "There is a remarkably close parallel between the problems of 
    the physicist and those of the cryptographer. The system on which 
    a message is enciphered corresponds to the laws of the universe, 
    the intercepted messages to the evidence available, the keys for 
    a day or a message to important constants which have to be 
    determined. The correspondence is very close, but the subject 
    matter of cryptography is very easily dealt with by discrete 
    machinery, physics not so easily."
        - Alan Turing

<h1>Understanding <i>grokking</i> in terms of representation learning dynamics <div style=color:red;>[in progress]</div></h1>

<p>
Last year, some researchers at OpenAI released a short paper called 
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02177">Grokking: Generalization Beyond Overfitting on 
    Small Algorithmic Datasets</a>. In this paper, they documented a curious phenomenon where 
    their neural networks would generalize long <i>after</i> overfitting their training dataset.
    Typically in machine learning, performance on the training dataset and validation dataset 
    improve together early in training, and if you continue training past a certain point the model will overfit the 
    training data and its performance on the validation set will decay. The OpenAI paper showed that
    the opposite can sometimes happen. Neural networks, in certain settings, can memorize their training dataset first,
    and then only much later "grok" the task, generalizing late in training. Here is a key 
    figure from the original paper, showing the prototypical grokking learning curve shape:
    
    <br><br>
    <img src="assets/figures/originalgrok.png">
    <figcaption>From Figure 1 of Power et al.: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02177">https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02177</a>. The model 
    memorizes the training data quickly, but then ~100k steps later begins to generalize.</figcaption> 
    <br>

    Grokking is not a universal phenomenon in deep learning. The setup of Power et al. was fairly unusual. Most notably, they studied 
    the problem of learning what they called "algorithmic datasets". By this they just mean learning a binary operation. Given some binary operation
    $\circ$, a model takes as input $a, b$ and must output $c$, where $a \circ b = c$. They use an decoder-only transformer which takes as input 
    the six-token seqeunce < a > < $ \circ $ > < b > < = > < ? > < eos > and produces a probability distribution over the tokens the operation
    is defined on ($a, b, c, \ldots$). The embeddings of $a, b, \ldots$ are trainable. The model is trained on a 
    subset of the pairs $((a, b), c)$ of the binary operation 
    table. Evidently, training in this setting leads to some bizarre learning behavior.
    <br><br>

    I think this paper captured people's attention for a few reasons.
    First, it simply adds to the existing constellation of surprising facts about 
    deep learning generalization
    (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02292">double descent</a> being another).
    Second, it may give some practitioners the (probably false) hope that if their network is struggling to learn, maybe they can just keep 
    training and the network will magically "grok" and perform well. Third, grokking is an example of an <i>unexpected model capability gain</i>. 
    It seems that <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Lp4Q9kSGsJHLfoHX3/more-is-different-for-ai">More is Different for AI</a>.
    With large language models, for instance, it is difficult to predict how performance on downstream tasks will improve as they are scaled up â€“
    large improvements sometimes occur suddenly when models hit a certain size. In the case of grokking, neural network performance can 
    unexpectedly improve, not as models are scaled up, but rather as they are trained for longer. These unexpected model capability gains 
    are interesting from an AI safety perspective since they suggest that it may be difficult to anticipate the properties of 
    future models, such as their potential for harm. Understanding these phase transitions in model behavior could prove 
    important for safety. 
    <br><br>


    What should we aim to understand about generalization, beyond overfitting, on algoritihmic datasets? Here are a 
    few key questions:
    <ol>
        <li>"Algorithmic datasets" are weird. <b>How do models generalize on them at all?</b> If you point out some dogs to a human
            child, pretty soon they can "generalize" and identify other dogs. But if you showed a child half the entries of 
            some binary op table, would you expect them to be able to "generalize" and fill in the other half? If the table was 
            for something familiar like addition or multiplication, they might recognize the pattern. But our networks have no 
            pre-existing knowledge about these operations. So it just seems bizarre that they would generalize at all. What even is 
            the <i>right</i> way to fill in missing entries in a binary op table, without knowing what operation it is? It seems the 
            only option is to evoke Kolmogorov complexity and identify the computationally simplest operation that matches the entries that
             are given to you (training data). How do neural networks solve this problem?
        </li>
        <li>
            In their paper on grokking, Power et al. observed that as they reduced the size of the training dataset, the time it took 
            before their models grokked (generalized) increased dramatically. This critical training data fraction was somewhere between 30-40%
            of the full table. <b>What is behind this dependence on training data fraction. </b>
        </li>
        <li>
            Why do neural networks <i>first</i> memorize their training dataset and only later generalize? <b>Why don't they generalize early,
            as is usually the case?</b>
        </li>
    </ol>
    We seek answers to these questions. Our explanations center around an analysis of representation learning. Our analysis is still 
    fairly preliminary, and could be wrong in important ways. It also is somewhat limited in scope, and definitely doesn't explain 
    everything one might want to understand about grokking. But we thought it was ready to be shared and critiqued. 

    <h2>Structured Representations Associated with Generalization</h2>
    
    We begin with an empirical observation. With an architecture similar to what Power et al. used<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>, we 
    train on the task of modular addition and observe grokking. Across training, we do a PCA on the token embeddings and visualize their first 
    two principle components. See the figure below:

    <br><br>
    <img src="assets/figures/ringplot.jpg" id="fullwidth">
    <figcaption>Figure 1 of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10343">our paper</a>, visualizing how embeddings change over training. The task here is modular addition ($p = 59$). Here 
        we show the embeddings simply projected onto the first two principle components. It apperas that a distinct ring shape is learned 
        late in training, emerging around the time that the network generalizes. 
    </figcaption>
    <br>

    We see something extremely cool when we do this: generalization coincides with the emergence of a distinctive ring 
    structure in the embeddings.
