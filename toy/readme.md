# Toy models
We keep toy models in jupyter notebooks. Running these notebooks typically does not take long (at most half an hour) on your personal laptop.
*  The main model is included in train_add.py
*  Figure4cd.ipynb (while also producing Figure4(c,d) from the paper) walks you through which results are returned by train_add.
*  Then we can make phase diagrams by running train_add for different parameters. Figure3.ipynb, Figure4[ab|cd].ipynb, Figure5.ipynb and Figure5d_permutation.ipynb aim to reproduce corresponding Figures in the paper.
