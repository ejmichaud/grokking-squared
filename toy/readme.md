# Toy models
We keep toy models in jupyter notebooks. Running these notebooks typically takes half an hour on your personal laptop.
*  The main model is included in train_add.ipynb
*  add_tutorial.ipynb walks you through which results are returned by train_add
*  Then we can make phase diagrams by running train_add for different parameters. Figure3.ipynb, Figure4.ipynb, Figure5.ipynb and Figure5d_permutation.ipynb aim to reproduce corresponding Figures in the paper.
